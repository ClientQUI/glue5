// Game functions the host can take over.
//
// Each entry pairs a field name with the function's name in the wasm name
// section. The build script finds the function, derives its signature from the
// module and routes every call to it through `Hooks::<field>`. An unset hook
// falls back to the original, and a hook can call the original through
// `orig::<field>`. Hooks receive the same `*mut Env` as imports. An entry
// the host leaves unset gives it a way to call that game function.
//
// This file is included by the build script.
//
// The hooks are grouped by the runtime module that implements them
// (`crates/glue5-runtime/src/<group>.rs`, whose `hooks()` sets them).
